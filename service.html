            My Experience With Serving
        </b>
        <p>
            Serving the community has been a huge part of my life for as long as I can remember. In one of the 
            pictures to the left, you'll see me in my choir uniform after singing at a Renaissance festival,
            which was some of the most fun I've ever had serving. Providing other people with themed music
            was especially satisfying above Christmas caroling for example because we
            not only added to the experience for others, but performing was a challenging experience at the time 
            due to the music being quite difficult at that age. Overcoming challenges to provide others with a
            service relates to my mission as a computer scientist as well. In my other pictures, you can witness
            me at my current job on an hour and 30-minute long call helping an elderly campus member manage their 
            Google Drive, and at my lifeguarding job over the summer a year ago. The lifeguard job allowed me to
            serve the community in the most direct capacity, as I was able to provide BLS to directly impact
            an infant's compromised well-being and in general, was able to provide quality and safe summer fun for 
            all families at the YMCA. In the same job, I was also able to teach swim lessons to children with 
            disabilities. Helping those who could not learn to swim on their own get to a point where they could be
            left alone in the water was one of the most enlightening and heartwarming experiences of my life
            and to this day is my favorite community activity I've ever participated in. In the future, I would
            like to focus more on using my computer science skills to help out my community. Either by making
            a project in the healthcare field or making important services more readily available to needing 
            customers, I would like to contribute to something that builds up the quality of life across the board
            rather than break it down. I'm extremely excited for what's to come and I am looking forward to
            applying my skills for the greater good in service of the community.
