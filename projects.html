            <p>
                Howdy and thanks for taking a look at my portfolio! I do a wide variety of projects most of which are motivated
                by fun. I love to make visualizations for my projects, so users can interact with them rather than just typing
                in a terminal. I tend to map out a lot of my projects using SDL2 and cpp then move them to more formal framework
                like javascript as seen here. There is so much more that I wish I could fit on this page but I hope this gives a
                good summary of my goals and skills as a programmer.

                A react dashboard displayed in the call center 24/7 that uses API endpoints and web scraping to get live data. 
                Some examples of what the call board can do is show how many calls are in the call queue, how many tickets 
                are in each assigned queue, who is working what manager shift at the time, all current technicians and their 
                current status, and so much more.

                This program, written in C++ using SDL2 to display graphics, gives a visual representation of a Lorenz 
                attractor in real time. This program allows you to change the variable values of the shape being drawn to 
                allow for the drawing of hundreds of combinations while giving you a fully customizable 3D view of what is 
                being drawn.

            <h2>Random Number Generator</h2>
            <p>This is an interface that generates up to 10 million numbers using a Mersenne Twister random number 
                generator i made from scratch. The RNG was seeded with your date and time when you entered this webpage
                Currently I have it set to display the first 5 or less numbers generated, however it does generate all numbers
                requested and appends them to an array. There are many applications of an rng, but an example of a usecase is
                shown below.

            <h2>Plinko (Click on it to play)</h2>
            <p>This is a live interface for a gambling simulation made using the random number generator above. Although this doesn't 
                have physics like a typical plinko game, this means each branch has an equal liklihood, therefore the bin return rates 
                at the bottom can be calculated using a binomial distribution, resulting in a perfect 100% return. This means as n 
                balls becomes large, you should never lose any money! This is just a fun way to show the functionality of the RNG.
