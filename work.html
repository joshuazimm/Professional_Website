                Thanks for taking a look at my Qualifications page. Although I have not had a ton of work
                experience within the computer science field, I have worked extensively throughout my adult
                life with an emphasis on customer service. I take pride in helping others in my work, so I
                have taken mostly jobs in customer support. I started with swim instructing and moved to
                Lifeguard managing and now am working as IT for the university. In the field of computer science
                I value user experience and helping programs work smoothly and intuitively for customers.
