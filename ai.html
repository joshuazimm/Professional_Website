        <h2>History of AI</h2>
        <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has a rich history dating back to the mid-20th century. Here are some key milestones:</p>
    
        <h3>1950s - Birth of AI</h3>
        <p>The term "Artificial Intelligence" is coined by John McCarthy. Researchers begin to explore the concept of machines that can mimic human intelligence.</p>
    
        <h3>1956 - Dartmouth Workshop</h3>
        <p>The first AI conference is held at Dartmouth College, where the groundwork for AI research and development is laid.</p>
    
        <h3>1960s - Early AI Programs</h3>
        <p>Early AI programs, such as the Logic Theorist and the General Problem Solver, are developed, demonstrating symbolic reasoning and problem-solving abilities.</p>
    
        <h3>1970s - Knowledge-Based Systems</h3>
        <p>Expert systems and knowledge-based systems become prominent, focusing on encoding human expertise into computer programs.</p>
    
        <h3>1980s - AI Winter</h3>
        <p>Due to overhyped expectations and unmet goals, AI funding declines, leading to the "AI winter" with reduced interest and support for AI research.</p>
    
        <h3>1990s - Rise of Machine Learning</h3>
        <p>Machine learning techniques, including neural networks and decision trees, gain traction, leading to breakthroughs in speech recognition and computer vision.</p>
    
        <h3>2000s - Big Data and Deep Learning</h3>
        <p>Advancements in computing power and the availability of big data fuel the resurgence of AI, with deep learning algorithms achieving impressive results in various applications.</p>
    
        <h3>2010s - AI in Everyday Life</h3>
        <p>AI-powered technologies like virtual assistants, recommendation systems, and autonomous vehicles become part of everyday life.</p>
    
        <h3>Present - AI in Healthcare, Finance, and More</h3>
        <p>AI is being used in healthcare for medical diagnosis, in finance for risk assessment, and in various industries for automation and optimization.</p>
